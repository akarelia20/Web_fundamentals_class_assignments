I have created the weather-forecast static web-page as shown in the expected-output screenshot by using CSS, HTML and javascript. The main function of this application is it converts the given temperature values from celsius to fahrenheit and visa-versa.
What does JS functions do in this project?

Upon-clicking on any of the cities (on the right -hand side of the page) shows an alert saying the "weather report is loading...".
upon accepting the cookies it dismisses the cookie policy message.
upon selecting a temperature unit it converts all the temperatures shown in the page to celsius or fahrenheit.
