This "Register an account page" has navigation bar, footer and a main content. I have used CSS and HTML to re-create this page. For the navigation and footer bar, I have used display flex and justify-content:space around property to align the items. In the main content there is form on the right side of the screen and some text content on the left side of the screen, both are aligned side by side using display flex again in combination with justify-content: space-around, align-items: center and main-container height: 570px. These properties with some some other CSS properties like background color and margin completes the look of the webpage.
