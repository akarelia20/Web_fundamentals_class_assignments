This project is a sample profile page of a job-networking site which I have recreated using only CSS and html (FYI: there is no backend or javascript involved). It has navigation-bar at the top and four other fields in the middle/main-content. It is showing the active "My profile" tab in the nav-bar. I have used flex and inline block display properties in conjunction with margin, padding, justify-content and align-items. I have also used some other CSS properties like border-radius, font-color, background-color, etc...
