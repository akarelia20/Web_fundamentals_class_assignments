This project focuses on flex display property in conjunction with justify-content property to move/adjust blocks -in this case images- in the middle/center in a way that there is an equal space between the images. One of the advantages using flex is, content can “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space and can be aligned with respect to their container or each other. Feel free to adjust your browser size and see how the content responds!!! (FYI-sample display and my version has different images)
